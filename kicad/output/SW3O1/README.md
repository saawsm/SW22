# SW32O1 - Single Channel Output Module

## About
This is a single channel E-Stim output module. It tries to mimic the output stage of the well-known Erostec ET312, or better, the MK-312.

The original design of this module was based on the design by [WendyTeslaburger/WT-312](https://github.com/WendyTeslaburger/WT-312).
