## SW2O2 - Single Channel Output Module

A single channel E-Stim output module. It tries to mimic the output stage of the well-known Erostec ET312, or better, the MK-312.

This module is functionally the same as the SW2O1 but uses a TO-220 package for the power limiting circuit. Allowing for the use of the IRF9Z24 P-Fet used in the MK-312.
